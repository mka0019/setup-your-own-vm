# Create a VM lab

## Your first VM > Ubuntu

What OS is your VM running?

It's running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS ( Noble Nombat)


What challenges did you face while creating your VM? What troubleshooting steps did you take to resolve those challenges and what did you research?

> I first tried installing the VM on my MacBook Pro, but it would only go up the start screen on Ubuntu and then start crashing and I could hear the fans.  I figured my laptop wasn't going to be able to handle the VM, so I switched to my Mac mini. At first because of the outdated OS it wouldn't work, but once I updated I was able to go through the entire setup seemlessly. 


How much RAM and hard disk space did you allocate to your VM? Why did you choose these amounts?

> RAM > 4096MB and HARD DISK > 32 GB. 
> These settings were choosen because they were recommended for the best performance. 


What do you think would happen if you allocated too much RAM to your VM?

> Allocating to much RAM, might slow down the host system, which I think what was causing my laptop to crash. It might even cause instability of the host runs out of memory. 


What settings did you change and why?
> Tried chaniging the 3D Acceleration for better grahics, unfortunately, that cause Mac computers to abort the VM. Its a known cause.


How did your VM perform before and after changing the settings?
> Will need to test this on Windows, unfortunately Mac doesn't support the above. 


What other settings do you think could be important for optimizing a VMâ€™s performance?

> Perhaps increase CPU count. Increase in CPU count allows multi-tasking.
